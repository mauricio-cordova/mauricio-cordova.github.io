Hello there, thank you for visiting. My name is Mauricio and I am currently working as a Junior Researcher at [TokoroLab](http://www.tokoro.env.waseda.ac.jp/index.html). My work is related to chemical processing in general and more recently to the recycling of Lithium Ion Batteries; but in all honesty, I am interested in all things physical chemistry, inorganic materials and chemical engineering.

I have also developed a big interest in everything computing for the last few years. So much so that I taught myself programming from the ground up and right now I am trying to learn as much as possible about the intersection between computing and chemistry, by fiddling around with Python scripts for scientific computing and some machine learning libraries.

If you are interested in my work and/or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me!
