I am a PhD. student from the [Laboratory for Materials Processing, Recovery and Recycling](https://webpark1169.sakura.ne.jp/lab/) belonging to the Department of Systems Innovation at the University of Tokyo. During the PhD., I have mainly worked with chemical processing of [inorganic phosphates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate), as my research was focused on phosphorus-containing substances that have industrial applications; but in all honesty, I am interested in inorganic chemistry and materials in general.

I have also developed a big interest in everything computing for the last few years. So much so that I taught myself programming from the ground up and right now I am trying to learn as much as possible about the intersection between machine learning and chemistry, by fiddling around with Python scripts and the RDkit package.
