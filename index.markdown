Hello there, thank you for visiting. My name is Mauricio and I am working as a Research Assistant at [Tokoro Laboratory](http://www.tokoro.env.waseda.ac.jp/en/index.html) at Waseda University. My work is related to chemical processing in general and the recycling of Lithium Ion Batteries in particular; but in all honesty, I am interested in all things physical chemistry and inorganic materials.

I have also developed a big interest in everything computing for the last few years. So much so that I taught myself programming from the ground up and right now I am trying to bridge the intersection between machine learning and experimental chemistry one script at a time.

If you are interested in my work and/or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me!
