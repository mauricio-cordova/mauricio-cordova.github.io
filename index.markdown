Hello there, thank you for visiting. My name is Mauricio and my research work is related to chemical processing for resource recovery in general and the recycling of Lithium Ion Batteries in particular; but in all honesty, I am interested in all things physical chemistry, inorganic materials and chemical engineering.

I have also developed a big interest in everything computing for the last few years. So much so that I taught myself programming from the ground up and right now I am trying to bridge the intersection between computing and chemistry, by fiddling around with Python scripts and some machine learning libraries.

If you are interested in my work and/or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me!
