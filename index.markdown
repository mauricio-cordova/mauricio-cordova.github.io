Hello there, thank you for visiting. My name is Mauricio and I am working as a Junior Researcher at [TokoroLab](http://www.tokoro.env.waseda.ac.jp/index.html). My current work is related to chemical processing and the recovery of valuable elements from diverse sources; but in all honesty, I am interested in all things chemical engineering and inorganic materials.

I have also developed a big interest in everything computing for the last few years. So much so that I taught myself programming from the ground up and right now I am trying to learn as much as possible about the intersection between computing and chemistry, by fiddling around with Python scripts for scientific computing and some machine learning libraries.

If you are interested in my work and/or would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me!
