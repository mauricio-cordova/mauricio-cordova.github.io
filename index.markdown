Hello there, thank you for visiting. My name is Mauricio and I graduated as a PhD. from the [Department of Systems Innovation at the University of Tokyo](https://www.sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/?lang=en) in March 2021. During my graduate studies, I have mainly worked with the chemical processing of [inorganic phosphates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphate), as my research was focused on phosphorus-containing substances that have industrial applications; but in all honesty, I am interested in physical chemistry and materials in general.

I have also developed a big interest in everything computing for the last few years. So much so that I taught myself programming from the ground up and right now I am trying to learn as much as possible about the intersection between machine learning and chemistry, by taking online courses and fiddling around with Python scripts, Kaggle datasets and the RDkit package.
